Easter is in spring. It is a great holiday. There are a lot of daffodils around in spring. Theyâ€™re very beautiful yellow flowers. In Britain Easter starts on Friday. People often eat hot-cross buns on this day. People give children chocolate eggs for Easter and the children can eat them on Easter Sunday. Some families have an Easter egg hunt. The parents hide Easter eggs and the children look for them. On Easter Sunday people go to church and give thanks to Christ. They sing songs, listen to music and sit for a big dinner. In Ukraine we make Easter cakes. An Easter cake is called paska. We paint eggs, too. Sometimes eggs are not real but are made of wood, paper or glass. A coloured egg is called pysanka.
